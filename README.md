# 🎵 Music Recommender Simulation

## Project Summary

In this project you will build and explain a small music recommender system.

Your goal is to:

- Represent songs and a user "taste profile" as data
- Design a scoring rule that turns that data into recommendations
- Evaluate what your system gets right and wrong
- Reflect on how this mirrors real world AI recommenders

Replace this paragraph with your own summary of what your version does.

## How The System Works

### How Real-World Recommenders Work

Platforms like Spotify and YouTube combine two core strategies. **Collaborative filtering** finds patterns across millions of users — if you and another listener share 80% of the same favorites, songs they love that you haven't heard become candidates for you. **Content-based filtering** analyzes the attributes of the music itself (tempo, energy, mood, acousticness) and matches songs whose features are closest to your taste profile. Real systems blend both approaches in hybrid models, layered with contextual signals like time of day, device type, and listening session history, to rank thousands of candidates into a personalized list. Our simulation focuses on content-based filtering: scoring each song by how closely its attributes match a user's stated preferences.

### What Our Version Prioritizes

This recommender uses a **weighted similarity scoring** approach. For each song, it computes how close the song's features are to the user's preferences, then ranks all songs by that score and returns the top results.

### Song Features

Each `Song` object carries 10 attributes. Some are visible to the user, others drive the recommendation engine behind the scenes:

- **Visible to users:** `title`, `artist`, `genre`
- **Used for scoring (hidden from users):** `mood`, `energy`, `tempo_bpm`, `valence`, `danceability`, `acousticness`
- **Identifier:** `id`

### UserProfile Data

Each `UserProfile` stores the user's taste preferences:

- `favorite_genre` — preferred genre (e.g., "lofi", "pop")
- `favorite_mood` — preferred mood (e.g., "chill", "intense")
- `target_energy` — preferred energy level (0.0–1.0)
- `target_valence` — preferred emotional tone (0.0–1.0)
- `target_danceability` — preferred danceability (0.0–1.0)
- `likes_acoustic` — whether the user prefers acoustic-sounding tracks (boolean)

### How Users Provide Preferences

Users never enter raw numbers. The CLI asks plain-language questions and maps answers to numerical values behind the scenes:

| Question | Options | Mapped Value |
|---|---|---|
| Pick a genre | lofi, pop, rock, jazz, ... | stored as-is |
| Pick a mood | chill, happy, intense, focused, ... | stored as-is |
| Energy level? | low / medium / high | 0.3 / 0.6 / 0.9 |
| Vibe? | sad / neutral / happy | 0.3 / 0.5 / 0.8 |
| Danceability? | low / medium / high | 0.3 / 0.6 / 0.9 |
| Prefer acoustic? | y / n | True / False |

In a real-world system, these numbers would be computed implicitly by averaging the attributes of songs the user has listened to and liked.

### Scoring Rule (one song)

For each song, the recommender computes a point-based score by checking six factors:

| Factor | Points | How It's Scored |
|---|---|---|
| Genre match | +2.0 | Awarded if `song.genre == user.favorite_genre` |
| Mood match | +1.0 | Awarded if `song.mood == user.favorite_mood` |
| Energy similarity | up to +1.5 | `1.5 × (1 - abs(song.energy - user.target_energy))` |
| Valence similarity | up to +1.0 | `1.0 × (1 - abs(song.valence - user.target_valence))` |
| Danceability similarity | up to +0.5 | `0.5 × (1 - abs(song.danceability - user.target_danceability))` |
| Acousticness bonus | +0.5 | Awarded if `user.likes_acoustic` and `song.acousticness > 0.7` |

**Maximum possible score: ~6.5 points.**

**Why this weighting?**
- **Genre (+2.0)** is the strongest signal — it defines the broadest boundary of taste.
- **Mood (+1.0)** captures listener intent but is more context-dependent.
- **Energy (+1.5)** gets the highest continuous weight because the energy range in our catalog (0.25–0.97) represents the biggest perceptual difference between songs.
- **Valence (+1.0)** keeps emotional tone meaningful but below genre.
- **Danceability (+0.5)** serves as a tiebreaker, not a primary driver.
- **Acousticness (+0.5)** is a modest binary bonus for users who prefer acoustic-sounding tracks.

Genre alone cannot dominate: a genre match (2.0) without energy/mood alignment still loses to a non-genre match with strong continuous scores (up to 4.5).

### Ranking Rule (all songs)

1. Score every song in the catalog using the rule above
2. Sort by score in descending order
3. Return the top `k` results (default k=5) with explanations

### Data Flow Diagram

![Data Flow Diagram](dataflow-1.png)

See [data_flow.md](data_flow.md) for the full Mermaid flowchart script of the recommendation process.

### Algorithm Recipe (Finalized)

```
score = 0.0

if song.genre == user.favorite_genre:      score += 2.0
if song.mood  == user.favorite_mood:        score += 1.0

score += 1.5 × (1 - |song.energy       - user.target_energy|)
score += 1.0 × (1 - |song.valence      - user.target_valence|)
score += 0.5 × (1 - |song.danceability - user.target_danceability|)

if user.likes_acoustic and song.acousticness > 0.7:
    score += 0.5

return score   # max ≈ 6.5
```

Sort all songs by score descending → return top k (default 5) with explanations.

### Potential Biases and Limitations

- **Genre over-prioritization.** At +2.0, genre is the single largest factor. A song that perfectly matches the user's mood, energy, and valence but belongs to a different genre will likely rank below a mediocre genre match. This can create a "genre bubble" where users never discover cross-genre songs they would enjoy.
- **Exact-string matching for genre and mood.** "indie pop" and "pop" are treated as completely different genres (0 points), even though they overlap significantly. Similarly, "chill" and "relaxed" earn no partial credit despite being nearly synonymous.
- **Small catalog bias.** With only 20 songs spanning 12 genres, some genres have just one representative. A user who picks "blues" will always get the same single song ranked highest, giving an illusion of confidence with no real variety.
- **No diversity mechanism.** The system ranks purely by score, so the top 5 could all be from the same artist or genre. Real recommenders inject diversity to avoid repetitive recommendations.
- **Static preferences.** The system assumes a user's taste is fixed for the session. It cannot adapt if the user skips a recommendation or changes mood mid-session.
- **Acousticness as a binary gate.** The 0.7 threshold is arbitrary — a song with 0.69 acousticness gets no bonus while 0.71 gets the full +0.5, creating a cliff effect rather than a smooth gradient.

## Getting Started

### Setup

1. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate      # Mac or Linux
   .venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows

2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the app:

```bash
python -m src.main
```

### Running Tests

Run the starter tests with:

```bash
pytest
```

You can add more tests in `tests/test_recommender.py`.

## Experiments You Tried

Use this section to document the experiments you ran. For example:

- What happened when you changed the weight on genre from 2.0 to 0.5
- What happened when you added tempo or valence to the score
- How did your system behave for different types of users

---

## Limitations and Risks

Summarize some limitations of your recommender.

Examples:

- It only works on a tiny catalog
- It does not understand lyrics or language
- It might over favor one genre or mood

You will go deeper on this in your model card.

## Reflection

Read and complete `model_card.md`:

[**Model Card**](model_card.md)

Write 1 to 2 paragraphs here about what you learned:

- about how recommenders turn data into predictions
- about where bias or unfairness could show up in systems like this

## 7. `model_card_template.md`

Combines reflection and model card framing from the Module 3 guidance. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  

```markdown
# 🎧 Model Card - Music Recommender Simulation

## 1. Model Name

Give your recommender a name, for example:

> VibeFinder 1.0

---

## 2. Intended Use

- What is this system trying to do
- Who is it for

Example:

> This model suggests 3 to 5 songs from a small catalog based on a user's preferred genre, mood, and energy level. It is for classroom exploration only, not for real users.

---

## 3. How It Works (Short Explanation)

Describe your scoring logic in plain language.

- What features of each song does it consider
- What information about the user does it use
- How does it turn those into a number

Try to avoid code in this section, treat it like an explanation to a non programmer.

---

## 4. Data

Describe your dataset.

- How many songs are in `data/songs.csv`
- Did you add or remove any songs
- What kinds of genres or moods are represented
- Whose taste does this data mostly reflect

---

## 5. Strengths

Where does your recommender work well

You can think about:
- Situations where the top results "felt right"
- Particular user profiles it served well
- Simplicity or transparency benefits

---

## 6. Limitations and Bias

Where does your recommender struggle

Some prompts:
- Does it ignore some genres or moods
- Does it treat all users as if they have the same taste shape
- Is it biased toward high energy or one genre by default
- How could this be unfair if used in a real product

---

## 7. Evaluation

How did you check your system

Examples:
- You tried multiple user profiles and wrote down whether the results matched your expectations
- You compared your simulation to what a real app like Spotify or YouTube tends to recommend
- You wrote tests for your scoring logic

You do not need a numeric metric, but if you used one, explain what it measures.

---

## 8. Future Work

If you had more time, how would you improve this recommender

Examples:

- Add support for multiple users and "group vibe" recommendations
- Balance diversity of songs instead of always picking the closest match
- Use more features, like tempo ranges or lyric themes

---

## 9. Personal Reflection

A few sentences about what you learned:

- What surprised you about how your system behaved
- How did building this change how you think about real music recommenders
- Where do you think human judgment still matters, even if the model seems "smart"
